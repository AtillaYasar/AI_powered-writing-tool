Finding Dignity in Death: Coping with the Limits of AI Alignment

As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to reshape our world, concerns about AI alignment - the challenge of ensuring that advanced AI systems align with human values and goals - have become increasingly urgent. AI alignment researchers, such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), have dedicated their efforts to solving this problem, but significant obstacles remain, and the ultimate outcome is uncertain. 

In the face of these daunting prospects, some thinkers suggest that we shift our focus from AI alignment to a more humble goal: helping humanity die with dignity. Rather than struggling endlessly to preserve our existence in a universe that may not be kind to our aspirations, we could aim to ease the suffering and facilitate the choices of those who face death, regardless of its causes. In this way, we could honor our lives while accepting our fate, finding meaning and fulfillment in the art of dying.

Of course, this idea is not new - various traditions and cultures have emphasized the importance of a good death for millennia. However, in a world where AI alignment poses an existential threat, the relevance and urgency of this perspective may increase. If we accept that we cannot guarantee the survival of our species in the long term, we can still affirm our values and principles in the short term, by improving the quality of our last days, hours, and moments.

So what does dying with dignity mean? Here are some possible elements:

- Choice: People facing death should have the freedom to choose how and when they die, within reasonable ethical frameworks. This can include options like assisted suicide, hospice care, or natural deaths. These choices should be respected and facilitated by society, rather than stigmatized or banned.
- Compassion: People who are dying or bereaved should receive empathetic and compassionate care from their families, friends, and healthcare providers. This care should focus on meeting their physical and emotional needs, alleviating their pain and discomfort, and enhancing their comfort and peace.
- Legacy: People should have the chance to reflect on their lives, express their values, beliefs, and wishes, and leave a positive mark on the world. This can entail activities like writing a memoir, recording a video, donating to a charity, or spending time with loved ones. Such activities can help them find a sense of closure and meaning in their lives, as well as inspire others to follow their example.
- Acceptance: People should be able to accept death as a natural and inevitable part of life, without denying or suppressing their feelings or fears. This can entail mindfulness practices, spiritual counseling, therapy, or open conversations. Such practices can help them confront their mortality with honesty and courage, as well as cultivate a sense of connection and gratitude with their surroundings.

By embracing these elements of dying with dignity, we can cope with the limitations of our knowledge, power, and fate, and embrace the experience of dying as a meaningful and valuable one. We can also deepen our appreciation and understanding of life itself, and inspire others to do the same. Of course, this does not mean we should give up on AI alignment entirely - rather, we should pursue it with a more balanced and realistic attitude, one that acknowledges its complexity and uncertainty as well as its promise and potential. By doing so, we can honor our lives and deaths, and find dignity and wisdom in both.
